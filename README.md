# [BIO373 - Genetics & Genomics](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/genetics-and-genomics-BIO-373)
After the main genetics and genomics lectures, the Genetics & Genomics class has 6 sessions dedicated to hands-on bioinformatics analyses in Python.
They will be split as follows:
- Two sessions (4h each) dedicated to an Introduction to Python and data analysis. And some hands-on exercises with a famous genetics example.
- Two sessions (4h each) dedicated to a Genetics project (that will be graded)
- Two sessions (4h each) dedicated to a Genomics project (that will be graded)

## Why Python?
Python and R are the two main languages used for bioinformatics analyses.
We chose Python over R in 2022, since other courses are also using Python (Machine Learning, ...). This makes it easier for the students to grasp the concepts of bioinformatics, with the removed burden to have to learn R and its syntax.

## Software requirements
Before starting this part of the course, you will need to install the following softwares on your computer:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Course support for hands-on projects in Python
The supports are made with Jupyter Notebook, and are in the following order:
